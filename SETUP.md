# Setup info about this project.

Mostly about gem and configuration setup notes that isn't specific to the project.


## About gem setup
=================================================================

if you see this the require false flag for gems.

"require: false"

this is needed for gems that are loaded elsewhere.
usually in the spec helper file.
basically you are loading it there instead of here.

this explains the issue.

### DATABASE CLEANER
=================================================================

#### url

https://github.com/bmabey/database_cleaner

note:
you don't need to do most of this if you install cucumber.



#### load the lib in the spec_helper

```
require 'database_cleaner'
```

 
#### set the database clean strategy

note that you only need to add this in if you are not using cucumber rails. 
that gem adds it to you.

```
# database cleaner strategy. default one on the page
config.before(:suite) do
  DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :transaction
  DatabaseCleaner.clean_with(:truncation)
end

config.before(:each) do
  DatabaseCleaner.start
end

config.after(:each) do
  DatabaseCleaner.clean
end
```



### HIGH VOLTAGE

throw static files in views/pages/your_page.rb


### DEVISE
==============================================================================

#### url

#### install

```
rails g devise:install
rails g devise:view
```

#### change root. (config/routes.rb)

you see this in devise when you run the devise install. not sure why. 

```
# ROOT
# need to set it for devise.
# change it from home#index to whatever controller and action you want too send it to.
root :to => 'home#index'
```
 
 
#### set up action mailer (config/environments/development.rb) 

``` 
# DEVISE
config.action_mailer.default_url_options { :host => 'localhost:3000' }
``` 

#### flash messages (app/views/layouts/application.html.erb)

odd that it doesn't add it. when you do the install.

```
<!-- devise -->
<p class="notice"><%= notice %></p>
<p class="alert"><%= alert %></p>
```


#### heroku. 3.2 (config/application.rb)
 
baiscally turns off precompile and does not allow access to models.
heroku might have some other other stuff that you need to do.

``` 
# heroku.
config.assets.initalize_on_precompile = false
```

#### create a user

```
rails g devise User 
```
